    <h1 dir="ltr">AusPost's Data Business</h1>
<p><em><time>Published on January 25, 2019</time></em></p>
<p>Auspost might be copping with 1 million complaints on an annual basis but they own a treasure trove of data that may have use cases for up and coming retailers and startups. AusPost owns a vast database of Australian addresses, granular data on e-commerce deliveries, summer vacation plans, export/import of small businesses and address movements. There are a few interesting use cases for this data</p>
<p>1. <strong>&nbsp;Real-time validation of address</strong> &ndash; I guess this is the most evident/popular use case where websites validate your exact address in real time. This validation can avoid human errors and improve delivery accuracy.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Targeting of Advertisements </strong>&ndash; Marketers can analyse the e-commerce buying patterns of suburbs and tailor the marketing campaign both online and offline to suit the needs of that particular suburb. Eg. For suburb with low e-commerce penetration, the Facebook ads can be about awareness and first-time incentives in contrast to a suburb with high penetration where repeat purchases have to be encouraged. Advertisements can also be targeted based on Mover statistics. Eg. Real estate offers can be floated in suburbs with a high move out count.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Commercial Property Hunting </strong>&ndash; Another use case is about selecting the right suburb for your small business. Postal data can be used to profile suburbs based on purchase patterns and import/export statistics. Eg. Suburbs with high package exports can be a good locality to find businesses with similar needs.</p>
<div><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQEWDVEpDPsx8Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1548396946600?e=1669852800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=PQaUb9DLLEY7WRehpxfvYKhGCvZznsucfS9tZWCJhl4" data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQEWDVEpDPsx8Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1548396946600?e=1669852800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=PQaUb9DLLEY7WRehpxfvYKhGCvZznsucfS9tZWCJhl4" /></div>
<p>Another set of use cases will emerge when this data is used in conjunction with enterprise data or data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on demography. About those another time.</p>
