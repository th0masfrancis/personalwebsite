    <h1>Amazon&rsquo;s Australian Problem</h1>
<p>Words like community engagement and local integration rarely find top priority in marketing playbooks. For Amazon, the American online retail juggernaut this &lsquo;local&rsquo; integration may be the missing piece in the puzzle to dominate Australia. In this country, which is a proudly immigrant nation, cultural integration is one of the key factors for success, be it a newly arrived immigrant or a corporation which is trying to gain market share.</p>
<p>Australian consumers are famous for preferring &lsquo;local&rsquo; corporations over &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; companies. Performance of Starbucks in this coffee drinking country is a clear evidence. Amazon&rsquo;s lackluster performance in Australia should be analyzed under this light.</p>
<p>Key factors which are slowing down Amazon&rsquo;s growth in the continent</p>
<p>1. <strong>Lack of Word of Mouth Uptake</strong> &ndash; Close-knit communities and regular social gatherings among the middle-aged population (Australian median age 37) means that word of mouth carries a lot of weight in an Australian consumer&rsquo;s decision on where to make retail purchases from. Amazon is absent from these barbeque side conversations.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Incumbent Network Effects</strong> &ndash; E-bay is the most popular online marketplace and has the largest number of customers and sellers. Driving the current buyers and sellers away from this platform and into Amazon&rsquo;s fold will be an uphill task.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Insufficient</strong> <strong>Localization of Content</strong> &ndash; Even though English speaking, Australian&rsquo;s are culturally distinct from the rest of the world. The prime programming (movies and music) should reflect this distinctness and feature more local content. Featuring INXS on Prime homepage is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Lack of Community Engagement</strong> &ndash; A more offline approach, by sponsoring local events like NFL and engaging with local communities will help in integration of Amazon into local communities.</p>
<p>For a company driven by data and analytics, this cultural integration may be a wrong&rsquo;un that Amazon has to face. What do you think will be the future of this retail gaint in Australia?</p>
