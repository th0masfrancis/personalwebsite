<h1>Why 2019 will not be the year of 5G</h1>
<p><em><time>Published on January 14, 2019</time></em></p>
<p>The year 2019 has been touted as the &lsquo;year of 5G&rsquo; at CES. Australian telecom majors (Telstra, Vodafone and Optus) have started 2019 with high expectations from their 5G spectrum. Here are a few reasons why that may not be the case, at least in Australia</p>
<p><strong>1. Not a 4G killer - </strong><em>yet</em></p>
<p>5G vendors promise peak download speeds anywhere between 1Gbps to&nbsp;4.5Gbps but the initial rollout of 5G in Australia will make use of the 3.6GHz band, which will not deliver the low latency, the high-speed promise of 5G. Performance of 3.6GHz band is very close to the 2.1GHz bands used in the 4G network. Hence there will only be an incremental change in the performance as perceived by the regular mobile user - at least, not enough to force a switch from 4G to 5G devices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Ban of Huawei in Infrastructure setup for 5G</strong></p>
<p>The network providers will have to set up on-ground network infrastructure. Telstra is ahead of Optus and Vodafone in this regard as they have started the deployment in various pockets of East Coast. This infrastructure roll-out is not expected to be complete till mid of 2020. A ban in place on Huawei and ZTE in Australia will impede the ability of service providers like Vodafone to deploy the infrastructure within this timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>3. Unavailability of 5G devices from Apple</strong></p>
<p>Apple which has a 50% market share in mobile phones in Australia has no 5G capability. Due to an ongoing tussle with its chipset vendor, there are no plans for including the 5G capability in 2019. Samsung who has the second place in market share may try to capitalize on this gap but might struggle to demonstrate a step change in performance to force the customers to ditch their iPhones and move into the Android ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>4. Pending Auction of Millimeter Wave (30 -300GHz) </strong></p>
<p>Using these frequencies service providers can provide large speeds and bandwidth. They provide the core of the value to end user in terms of large data volumes. Millimetre wave frequencies are not yet auctioned in Australia. So it is unlikely that the specialized use cases which will benefit from 5Gs support of high density of devices and large data bandwidths will get traction in 2019.</p>
<p>5G will not have a substantial impact on the regular mobile phone user. The use cases will be focused more on high-density, low-latency applications like robotics, IoT. Telcos will have to find and sell these new use cases which delivers step improvements to productivity for their business customers. A typical example of such an application will be a swarm of wireless security cameras or a private gaming network. 5G technology is also ripe for re-sale opportunities for smaller telcos - at least in Australian cities with its huge population density. 5G is a technology which is waiting for a disruptive use case. We will have to watch and wait the space till 2020!</p>
