    <h1 dir="ltr">Enterprise Agility at Fish 'n Chips Co</h1>
<p><em><time>Published on May 17, 2019</time></em></p>
<p>After a couple of years of helping enterprises become agile, here is my take of what it means to be an 'Agile Enterprise'. </p>
<p>Say, you are an <em>Agile</em> 'Fish and Chips' shop facing decline in revenues. Word on the street is that Millennials are taking a liking for burgers. As you are agile, one of your chefs will experiment with a fish burger (adjacency)&nbsp;for a week,then, based on the customer feed back he will improve (iterate) and perfect the fish burger. The team then, further iterates on different types of patties and starts churning out the meanest burgers (pivot) in town bringing your revenue back up. Cheers all around! However now, the millennials have moved on from burgers to 'superfoods'. You are not worried, your Agile team is all set for the next sprint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every business owner will dream of such a crack team who will adapt to the competitive market landscape including change in customer preferences, suppliers and competitors (Potter's 5 Forces) but, how do we get there?</p>
<p>For our Fish and Chips shop, having chefs who trained themselves in the new and innovative art of patty preparation helped(cross trained). The waiters were sensitive to customer needs and their passion to bring smiles (customer experience) helped them identify the winning item (product backlog). Finally, you as the owner had empowered them to experiment and fail fast with their menu.</p>
<p>Passion for improved customer experience is the fuel for agility. Cross skilled and Self managed teams are the engines that drive it and an enterprise which tolerates failures ensures that agility is sustainable. These 3 aspects fall under the umbrella of Culture. Journey to enterprise agility is an exercise in cultural change and my mantra is</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Customer Centricity</em></li>
<li><em>Cross Trained and Self Managed Teams</em></li>
<li><em>Build Quick;Fail Fast</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you think Enterprise Agility is relevant for your organisation? Can employees at all levels contribute to this culture or should it be driven from senior management?</p>
<p><em>Small companies based out of Perth are welcome to reach out to me for pro-bono engagements to help your companies achieve agility.&nbsp;Happy to help. Also thanks to @Henry Yang for letting me borrow some of his wisdom.</em></p>
